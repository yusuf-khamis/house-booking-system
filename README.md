<h1>House Booking System</h1>
<h5>A minimal project I made for someone else's final year project</h5>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A minimal system to enable employees of a company to book houses for the company, it is minimal according to instructions provided and just basically features registration, booking and changing of houses.</p>
<h2>Entry into the system</h2>
<p>One has to login to gain access to the system using your employee number and a password, and before that you have to register to be able to login, thats the way to access the system.</p>
<h2>Booking a house</h2>
<p>After a login, if the houses are still available, one has the opportunity to book one or change if for any reason they want to change, the system doesn't ask for a reason though. But after such a request, they have to wait till the admin sees the request and approves.</p>
<h2>Information viewing</h2>
<p>The user's get to view their information on a minimal interface and they can edit them too including their passwords</p>
<h2>Adiministrator's part</h2>
<p>The administrator's part is just to view the available requests and approve or deny them and can view all users with their details, can reset their passwords, block them for any reasons there might be and view all the houses and their current status</p>
